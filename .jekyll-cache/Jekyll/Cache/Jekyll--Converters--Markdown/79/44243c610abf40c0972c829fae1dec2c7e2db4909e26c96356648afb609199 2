I"›<p>So, if you missed the first part, <a href="../panel-anatomy.1/">thatâ€™s here</a>. For those of you who read it, weâ€™re continuing this dissection of how one figure got drawn in one of the panels in Neue Welt.</p>

<p>Our figure, having been refined in a separate file, is now located in the panel, which means I now have to build the relationship she has to her surroundings, and the other people in them. A lot of that is established through body language, which is part of why we reintegrated her now. As I closed the last post off by saying, we need to ensure that any drift from the original rough drawing is not a problem.</p>

</span></p>

<p>The first thing is, the poor girl is standing there naked. So we have to clothe her. In the image above on the left, in a new layer, and using a standout colour to improve visibility, Iâ€™ve drawn the outline of the dress that sheâ€™s wearing, as well as the shoes that sheâ€™ll appear in.</p>

<p><em>Drawing my figures nude is part of a process of ensuring that, even when there are complex relationships between them, the figures are anatomically properly proportioned, that limbs are in positions and shown with the correct foreshortening etc. In a frame like the fight Karolina has with her tormentor, this was a really important thing, and I hope to do a breakdown of that or a similar panel later.</em></p>

</span></p>

<p>The process here should look familiar: adding a layer with opaque fill below the linework, in this case the lines of the dress. Having done that, Iâ€™m setting the opacity of that layer of fill to a translucent value.</p>

<p><span class="md-img-small">

</span></p>

<p>This stage is subtle: The dress goes both <em>in front</em> of Karolina, and where we see it between her legs, from our low angle on the platform, <em>behind her</em>. So the dress fill, having already been cut out, is duplicated, and the new copy put behind her.</p>

<p>Now, I can trim away the front layer to match the line of her hem in the front. Because itâ€™s translucent, itâ€™s easier to see what Iâ€™m doing.</p>

<p><span class="md-img-small">
<img src="https://neue-welt-images.s3.amazonaws.com/banishment/figure-drawing-27.png" alt="rough figure" />
</span></p>

<p>Returning both layers to full opacity, the dress now works both behind her in front at the legs. But it now completely covers her arms. I also needed to erase the front hemline where it crosses her legs. Keeping the colour fill and linework separate makes a lot of this kind of prioritizing easier.</p>

<p><span class="md-img-small cl">
<img src="https://neue-welt-images.s3.amazonaws.com/banishment/figure-drawing-28.png" alt="rough figure" />
</span></p>

<p>But work needs to be done to deal with those arms. That starts by hiding the dress, and duplicating the entire figure of Karolina. At this point, the linework and the fill have been merged into a single layer. This made some things easier when moving her figure in front of other layers. Iâ€™ve hidden the original figure, and now Iâ€™ve used the eraser tool to cut away the are of the duplicate figure that has the arms â€“ the thing goes in front of the dress â€“ away.</p>

<p><span class="md-img-small cl">

<p><span class="md-img-small cr">
<img src="https://neue-welt-images.s3.amazonaws.com/banishment/figure-drawing-30.png" alt="rough figure" />
</span></p>

<p>The extraneous parts are deleted, and now I lock all the parts of the remainder, which consists of the merged together linework and fill colour. Next, I <em>unlock</em> the fill, so I can use the eraser on it, and leave the linework intact. Itâ€™s the fill colour that will knock out the dress when we put this new layer in front of everything, so this is the key step.</p>

<p><span class="md-img-small cl">

<p><span class="md-img-small cr">
<img src="https://neue-welt-images.s3.amazonaws.com/banishment/figure-drawing-33.png" alt="rough figure" />
</span></p>

<p>Once the colour is trimmed to the profile of the part of the arms that will be in front of the dress, I can unlock and delete the linework that is outside the fill area. I turn all the layers on, and ensure that the cutaway arms are in the front, and things look good again.</p>

</span></p>

<p>A similar process to the dress, but without the need for overlayering happens with her shoes.</p>

</span></p>

<p>And thatâ€™s it! A single figure, in a single panel is now complete. Except, of course for all the other things that will have to happen: adding hair, correcting colour, adjusting clothing, adding shade and toneâ€¦ When itâ€™s broken down into steps like this, it seems (even to me) exhausting! But the average time per panel, up to this point is about a day of work. So given all the other things â€“ initial concepts, roughs, composition, research into things like what railway carriages looked like, or typical railway stations in Germany in 1930, the actual time for this process might be an hour. Which is not that bad.</p>

<p>The conductor/guard, and Karolinaâ€™s guardians who also appear in the scene did require this treatment too. But because they donâ€™t appear in many panels, and theyâ€™re somewhat obscured by the other details, less time goes in to them in a panel like this.</p>
