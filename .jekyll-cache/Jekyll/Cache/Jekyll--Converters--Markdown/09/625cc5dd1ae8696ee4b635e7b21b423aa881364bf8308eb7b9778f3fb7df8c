I"#<p><strong>Neue Welt</strong> (which is how my graphic novel normally gets referred to,) is the story of two people, Wolf Scheier, and Karolina Stott. They form an odd couple who navigate an era that seems to be the 1930’s and 1940’s.</p>

<p>But <em>seems</em> is the operative word here. Neue Welt is an <em>alterate</em> history, where just about everything we know starts off being true, but tweaks are introduced as the story progresses.</p>

<p>I don’t want to be someone who gives away the plot, and I won’t, but there are spoilers for what is planned in this page, stuff I’m OK with telling people. But if you aren’t interested in knowing anything about what <strong>Neue Welt</strong> will be, better stop reading now.</p>

<p>Purportedly, when Mao Tse Tung was asked what the impact of the French Revolution was, he said, “too soon to tell”. That probably never happened, but the point is, events happen, and out of them come changes that so overwhelm everyone, that seeing the world any other way becomes hard, impossible. We lack perspective, so we accept distortion.</p>

<p>Most of the moral truths, certainties that emerged from out of the Second World War are far beyond our ability to set distance from. Of course, different parts of the world saw the war very differently. For the US, it was an adventure, happening on foreign soil. For the UK, it was an existential moment where they came to see themselves as the final bulwark of an existing civilization. For the Soviets, it was a profound recurrence of a sacrifice at a scale that others cannot imagine. And for the Germans, it began as a rise of national pride, destroyed in a harsh armistice, but ended in a profound shame that drew nationalism itself into a black hole of disrepute.</p>

<p>So, the postwar world has been one of profoundly different world views, built on the supposedly immutable moral lessons of 1939-1945. And that has divided us, made us unable to believe in a common humanity.</p>
