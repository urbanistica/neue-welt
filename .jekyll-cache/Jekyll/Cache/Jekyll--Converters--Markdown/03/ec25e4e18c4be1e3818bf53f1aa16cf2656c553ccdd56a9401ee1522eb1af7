I"È<p>Neue Welt (which is how the graphic novel normally gets referred to,) is the story of two people, Wolf Scheier, and Karolina Stott. They form an odd couple who navigate an era that seems to be the 1930â€™s and 1940â€™s.</p>

<p>But <em>seems</em> is the operative word here. Neue Welt is an <em>alterate</em> history, where just about everything we know starts off being true, but tweaks are introduced as the story progresses.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t want to be someone who gives away the plot, and I wonâ€™t, but there are spoilers for what is planned in this page, stuff Iâ€™m OK with telling people. But if you arenâ€™t interested in knowing anything about what Neue Welt will be, better stop reading now.</p>
