I"×<p>Now begins the markup task for phase one. Each spread will be gone over, to identify what work needs to be done to complete the next substage.</p>

<p>The goal is really to prep the panels by taking them through the complete drawing stage. That lets me move on to the other things that will be done: clothes, hair, and faces.</p>

<p>In panel 2, a previous version, based on this composition, he mother raises her head. I decided to add a pillow, but forgot to include it. So that has to go in.</p>

<p>In the third panel, a family member pointed out that the reading order would be better if the captions were reversed. An easy change, and one that will improve that transition a lot.</p>

<p>In the last panel, I omitted to include the line work that shows the seats inside the back of the car. I gotta do that in Concepts, which is the best drawing tool for this project.</p>
