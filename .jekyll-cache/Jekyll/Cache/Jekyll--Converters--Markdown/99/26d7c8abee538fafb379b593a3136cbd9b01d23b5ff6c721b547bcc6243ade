I"°<p>Eleven pages, and Iâ€™m now posting the markups that Iâ€™m using to priortize needed changes to the existing pages. My previous post was about page one, and hereâ€™s page two.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll take a slightly different approach, and we can discuss the page, drawing attention to the changes coming. There are numbers marked up on various panels: those can be the starting point for whatâ€™s to come next.</p>

<p>1.: The first panel was a landmark in getting the technical approach to these drawings right. The aim was to visualize a table, with 7 family members around it, seated and standing, and in motion, with gestures, eye-lines and body language meant to tell a story. Wolf sits with his back to us, reading a book. His older brothers are at the table, or arriving; at the head the father is impassive, patriarchal. The mother, beside him, who has provided the meal, makes a tender gesture to the last son. He balances as he moves between the crowded chairs, and his brother to his left is oblivious, preoccupied with getting his meal.</p>

<p>Another brother, to the left of Wolf, takes a moment to look over at Wolf, absorbed in his book. Perhaps he is the brother that takes a stronger interest in his little brother; his physical presence, as a robust, well-built farmboy contrasts with the skinny bookworm. Beside him, another brother shuts out the noise of the family and concentrates on his borscht.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not saying this is some kind of modern-day Laocoon â€“ but it is an exercise in trying to understand the potential of the tools Iâ€™ve adopted. The panels arenâ€™t drawn in order, so this panel reached this state some time in early October or maybe late September. It replaced a rough, but gestural panel that was part of starting to solidiy the anticipated style of the book.</p>

<p>I feel like the original captures some essence of what the panel is, but the style isnâ€™t up to the complex depiction in the current version. But it has a nice looseness. So this panel wants to reconcile those two tendencies. Harness the complex relationships in the frame, but let the lines relax a bit, perhaps.</p>

<p>The second panel, with Wolf drawing under a tree, seems to fit pretty well with my current goals, so for this round, no changes here.</p>

<p>2.: The third panel went through a number of stages and attempts to get to the current version. It represents a technical approach that I wasnâ€™t really able to get before. The idea of the boat ribs being a strong graphic element has been there from the beginning, but figuring out how to make that work â€“ and especially the progressive mutation of the curves of the ribs was a challenge.</p>

<p><img src="https://neue-welt-images.s3.amazonaws.com/posts/childhood+p5a.png" alt="boat ribs" /></p>

<p>In this previous version, something of the idea got in. At the time, I was playing with abstraction and stylization that I decided against. Iâ€™ve made a decision about how the images serve the story, and it tended to move against the looks I was trying out.</p>

<p>I think this comes from the idea that Wolf and Karolinaâ€™s lives are not going to seem separated from our own. They have problems, situations that we can imagine reacting to. In previous years, before the pandemic, I think we all looked at times of extremity, like the Second World War, and saw those times as qualitatively different from our lives. But I think now we tend to understand better that all times can, quickly, become extraordinary. What we are going through, a planet fighting infection, is as extraordinary as any other time.</p>

<p>The upshot is, I felt that stylization tends to work against that sense, at least the kind I was playing with. The story is better served by images that communicate their rootedness in lives related to our own.</p>

<p>The essence of this panel is fine: I want to try approaches to the background that may provide it with some texture, and tell us more about the apprenticeship, perhaps.</p>

<p>3.: The scene where Wolf enlists seems to me like the most tragic in the book to this point. All the misfortunes of the War of course stem from this decision. And Wolf is being berated by an enlistment officer, when already the foundations of the life Wolfâ€™s family has had, perhaps for centuries, has been sacrificed, in the form of his brothers.</p>

<p>It also marks the moment when Wolfâ€™s tendency to defer to authority becames clearer. Up til now, he has been a slightly dreamy kid, lost in his books and his drawings. The boat image in some ways portrays a kind of golden cage; here is where Wolf leaves the safety of the cage, but not for freedom.</p>

<p>How Iâ€™ll handle this panel isnâ€™t clear to me yet: I expect to retain the main elements, including the poster that is then echoed in Wolfâ€™s situation in the next panel. But in the original sketches, there were more figures, a sense of bustle. Perhaps that will be part of it.</p>

<p>4.: The trench scene is one that is waiting for the capabiities of other software, beyond Concepts. The dismembered body is almost comical in this form; a bit like the Black Knight in Monty Python, if you ask me.</p>

<p>But thatâ€™s because I want to establish the truth or authority of each figure before transitioning to the next technical stages. So the main changes here will be about the background, which tells us everything we will get to know about Wolfâ€™s war experience.</p>
