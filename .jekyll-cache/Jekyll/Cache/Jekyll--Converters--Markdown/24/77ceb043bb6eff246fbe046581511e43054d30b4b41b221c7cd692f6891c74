I"ú<p><strong>Neue Welt</strong> (which is how my graphic novel normally gets referred to,) is the story of two people, Wolf Scheier, and Karolina Stott. They form an odd couple who navigate an era that seems to be the 1930‚Äôs and 1940‚Äôs.</p>

<p>But <em>seems</em> is the operative word here. Neue Welt is an <em>alterate</em> history, where just about everything we know starts off being true, but tweaks are introduced as the story progresses.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want to be someone who gives away the plot, and I won‚Äôt, but there are spoilers for what is planned in this page, stuff I‚Äôm OK with telling people. But if you aren‚Äôt interested in knowing anything about what <strong>Neue Welt</strong> will be, better stop reading now.</p>

<p>Purportedly, when Mao Tse Tung was asked what the impact of the French Revolution was, he said, ‚Äútoo soon to tell‚Äù. That probably never happened, but the point is, events happen, and out of them come changes that so overwhelm everyone, that seeing the world any other way becomes hard, impossible. We lack perspective, so we accept distortion.</p>
