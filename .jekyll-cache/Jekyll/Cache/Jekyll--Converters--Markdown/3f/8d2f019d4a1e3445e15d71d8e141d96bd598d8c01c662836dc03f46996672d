I"L<p>Eleven pages, and I’m now posting the markups that I’m using to priortize needed changes to the existing pages. My previous post was about page one, and here’s page two.</p>

<p>I’ll take a slightly different approach, and we can discuss the page, drawing attention to the changes coming. There are numbers marked up on various panels: those can be the starting point for what’s to come next.</p>

<p>1.: The first panel was a landmark in getting the technical approach to these drawings right. The aim was to visualize a table, with 7 family members around it, seated and standing, and in motion, with gestures, eye-lines and body language meant to tell a story. Wolf sits with his back to us, reading a book. His older brothers are at the table, or arriving; at the head the father is impassive, patriarchal. The mother, beside him, who has provided the meal, makes a tender gesture to the last son. He balances as he moves between the crowded chairs, and his brother to his left is oblivious, preoccupied with getting his meal.</p>

<p>Another brother, to the left of Wolf, takes a moment to look over at Wolf, absorbed in his book. Perhaps he is the brother that takes a stronger interest in his little brother; his physical presence, as a robust, well-built farmboy contrasts with the skinny bookworm. Beside him, another brother shuts out the noise of the family and concentrates on his borscht.</p>

<p>I’m not saying this is some kind of modern-day Laocoon – but it is an exercise in trying to understand the potential of the tools I’ve adopted. The panels aren’t drawn in order, so this panel reached this state some time in early October or maybe late September. It replaced a rough, but gestural panel that was part of starting to solidiy the anticipated style of the book.</p>

<p>I feel like the original captures some essence of what the panel is, but the style isn’t up to the complex depiction in the current version. But it has a nice looseness. So this panel wants to reconcile those two tendencies. Harness the complex relationships in the frame, but let the lines relax a bit, perhaps.</p>

<p>The second panel, with Wolf drawing under a tree, seems to fit pretty well with my current goals, so for this round, no changes here.</p>

<p>2.: The third panel went through a number of stages and attempts to get to the current version. It represents a technical approach that I wasn’t really able to get before. The idea of the boat ribs being a strong graphic element has been there from the beginning, but figuring out how to make that work – and especially the progressive mutation of the curves of the ribs was a challenge.</p>
