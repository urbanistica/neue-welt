I"?<p><strong>Neue Welt</strong> (which is how my graphic novel normally gets referred to,) is the story of two people, Wolf Scheier, and Karolina Stott. They form an odd couple who navigate an era that seems to be the 1930’s and 1940’s.</p>

<p>But <em>seems</em> is the operative word here. Neue Welt is an <em>alterate</em> history, where just about everything we know starts off being true, but tweaks are introduced as the story progresses.</p>

<p>I don’t want to be someone who gives away the plot, and I won’t, but there are spoilers for what is planned in this page, stuff I’m OK with telling people. But if you aren’t interested in knowing anything about what <strong>Neue Welt</strong> will be, better stop reading now.</p>

<h3 id="world-war-two-and-our-moral-universe">World War Two and Our Moral Universe</h3>

<p>Purportedly, when Mao Tse Tung was asked what the impact of the French Revolution was, he said, “too soon to tell”. That probably never happened, but the point is, events happen, and out of them come changes that so overwhelm everyone, that seeing the world any other way becomes hard, impossible. We lack perspective, so we accept distortion.</p>

<p>Most of the moral truths, certainties that emerged from out of the Second World War are far beyond our ability to set distance from. Of course, different parts of the world saw the war very differently. For the US, it was an adventure, happening on foreign soil. For the UK, it was an existential moment where they came to see themselves as the final bulwark of an existing civilization. For the Soviets, it was a profound recurrence of a sacrifice at a scale that others cannot imagine. And for the Germans, it began as a rise of national pride, destroyed in a harsh armistice, but ended in a profound shame that drew nationalism itself into a black hole of disrepute.</p>

<p>So, the postwar world has been one of profoundly different world views, built on the supposedly immutable moral lessons of 1939-1945. And that has divided us, made us unable to believe in a common humanity. And those four countries are only four. Every country, including new ones, and ones that disappeared, peoples, and those who were nearly exterminated, all have identities, all over the world, that changed crucially in the shadow of the last global war.</p>

<p>The small tweaks that I make in Neue Welt are a path to different moral conclusions about the war. This happens, I hope, even when many of its fundamental realities, and especially the ones that stand as colossal landmarks in our morality – The Holocaust, the A-bomb, assumptions about leadership and the nature of evil – only shift in small degrees from what actually happened.</p>

<p>This project is not a revisionism. It doesn’t deny anything that <em>did</em> happen. It simply says, each small thing could have been different, but in a parallel reality. And even a few small changes, in the right place, can lead to greatly different conclusions. And so, it proposes that accepting and rejecting different small things, would place us in a very different moral universe.</p>

<p>An example that is close to home, for me. My mother, who was herself an illustrator, grew up in the London of the 1930’s and 40’s. Never evacuated, she lived with her family throughout the war, in Central West London, not far from Buckingham Palace, in the districts where palace servants lived.</p>

<p>She sat on the couch, with the rest of my family in July 1969, when men first landed on the moon. She understood the extraordinary moment it was, probably more than 14 year old me. But it was shadowed for her by the fact that the American space program had been so profoundly influenced by Werner von Braun, the Nazi who developed the V2 rocket. It was this rocket that truly brought terror to her, as a girl of the same age as I was, that hot July night. The air raids, the dogfights over London had been fearful. But the V2 was something else.</p>

<p>And, she knew, von Braun had <em>gotten away with it</em>. He was welcomed like a hero, when 2 men bounced next to their ungainly LEM, for all the world to see. His rockets were built by slaves, in underground tunnels, and fired, without even a pretence that exact aiming was possible, into the heart of populations. True technological terrorism by states had begun. And the US had embraced him.</p>

<p>What are the moral decisions that allows a person’s job description from one form of technology to another, to provide a halo to such a man, or put him in the dock at Nuremburg? Our moral universe is veneer that hides many arbitrary decisions, facts that are selected, others that are ignored.</p>

<p>In Neue Welt, the story is a slow permutation from the world we take as historically real, to one that allows other facts, other decisions, and a different set of certainties.</p>

<p>A novel is not a lecture. It’s not a thesis. It’s not an object lesson. It’s not a moral tale, in itelf, though it contains its own morality. In <strong>Neue Welt</strong>, my two characters, and the child they raise together are the core of the story. Wildly different in temperament, both are, in some degree, drawn to each other, in the ways that opposites not only attract, but also reveal what is painfully the same between them.</p>

<p>Karolina – hurt but resourceful, angry but capable of overcoming her anger, immoral to the world, but containing her own profound sense of truth: Wolf, with his own pain, but also a belief in systems, aware that the world’s impulse to reward can require flexibility and adaptation, but sometimes the victim of his own rigiditiy; morally certain, but ultimately uncertain of his own sense of truth. Each finds in the other a way to cope, as they live through extraordinary times.</p>
