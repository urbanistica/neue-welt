I"„<p>Eleven pages, and Iâ€™m now posting the markups that Iâ€™m using to priortize needed changes to the existing pages. My previous post was about page one, and hereâ€™s page two.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll take a slightly different approach, and we can discuss the page, drawing attention to the changes coming. There are numbers marked up on various panels: those can be the starting point for whatâ€™s to come next.</p>

<p>1.: The first panel was a landmark in getting the technical approach to these drawings right. The aim was to visualize a table, with 7 family members around it, seated and standing, and in motion, with gestures, eye-lines and body language meant to tell a story. Wolf sits with his back to us, reading a book. His older brothers are at the table, or arriving; at the head the father is impassive, patriarchal. The mother, beside him, who has provided the meal, makes a tender gesture to the last son. He balances as he moves between the crowded chairs, and his brother to his left is oblivious, preoccupied with getting his meal.</p>

<p>Another brother, to the left of Wolf, takes a moment to look over at Wolf, absorbed in his book. Perhaps he is the brother that takes a stronger interest in his little brother; his physical presence, as a robust, well-built farmboy contrasts with the skinny bookworm. Beside him, another brother shuts out the noise of the family and concentrates on his borscht.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not saying this is some kind of modern-day Laocoon â€“ but it is an exercise in trying to understand the potential of the tools Iâ€™ve adopted. The panels arenâ€™t drawn in order, so this panel reached this state some time in early October or maybe late September. It replaced a rough, but gestural panel that was part of starting to solidiy the anticipated style of the book.</p>
