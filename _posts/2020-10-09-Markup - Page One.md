Now begins the markup task for phase one. Each spread will be gone over, to identify what work needs to be done to complete the next substage. 

The goal is really to prep the panels by taking them through the complete drawing stage. That lets me move on to the other things that will be done: clothes, hair, and faces.

In panel 2, a previous version, based on this composition, he mother raises her head. I decided to add a pillow, but forgot to include it. So that has to go in.

In the third panel, a family member pointed out that the reading order would be better if the captions were reversed. An easy change, and one that will improve that transition a lot.

In the last panel, I omitted to include the line work that shows the seats inside the back of the car. I gotta do that in Concepts, which is the best drawing tool for this project.

As these, and other changes are completed, I'll upload the corrected versions to the storyline at the head of the page, under the video.
