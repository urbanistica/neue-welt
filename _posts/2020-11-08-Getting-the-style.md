Above are the previous and the current version of the first panel of the second page of Neue Welt. It's a fairly big transformation. The previous version of the panel was itself a transformation of the original concept. 

There are about seven panels in the book right now that are the target of this treatment as the next phase of the process to finished pages. If you go through the book from the home page, you can pick these out, because they're outlined in yellow. 

In many cases, these panels were breakthroughs. The scene around the table was one of those. The technical challenge of drawing numerous figures interacting in a social situation, and also transmitting something about the dynamic of the family was the goal. I'm much happier with the new version, just from a composition and interactionn POV: the mother is solicitous, the older brothers carry their own weight, and we can focus on all of them; their faces are turned towards Wolf enough to allow their glances to communicate.

The gentle hand of the big, strong older brother remains – that indicated something of how I imagine Wolf's relationship: caring, but ultimately dominated by a kind of maleness. By the end of the page, all the brothers have been chewed up and spat out by the War.

The father is a more brooding figure, and I wanted the directly facing pose to have something of Willian Blake in it, although no specific work is referred to – but the features, the broad face, the impassive quality with a hint of anger, brutishness, wisdom and strength seems to me like one of Blake's patriarchs.

The key figure is the mother's care. We saw her with yellow, straw like hair at Wolf's birth: now she is grey. But she sits askew on her chair, and ensures that Wolf eats some borscht as he obsessively consumes pages. 

The logic of Wolf seated at the head of the table bothered me: that led to the positioning of the mother and father at either end of the table... which is probably the same one that Wolf was born on, we can assume...

The background is eliminated. Although we miss the details of the farmhouse, for me the change makes it more like a dreamed recollection, the way Wolf might recollect his childhood in the time after, when all was gone...
