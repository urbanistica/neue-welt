I've been aiming at the point where the first section of the Neue Welt book is ready enough to show to people. And, now it is! after more than two months of 10-14 hour days.

That's not necessarily the moment when it's complete, finished, tweaked and fully detailed. I am really interested in the process of creating the book, so I also want to expose it to the world in incomplete form, and then let interested people track the process of polishing.

At the same time, I don't think the first things you see posted should be the original, messy, almost meaningless sketches; even though those are the real genesis of the section that's online. There's a balance to be struck.

So, that's where it is, as of this post. It should be pretty easy to read it, and get what's going on, about as well as the finished version. But there are a lot of things omitted that will be added in the immediate future. And if you decide to follow what I'm doing, you'll see those as they happen.

Those include things that are quite obvious: faces, for one. And proper clothing that matches the time. But also lighting, and shade and shadow, and sometimes othe similar things that convey time, season, weather and so on. 

I actually think that having these things omitted and seeing them add to the final product is more engaging. How the book gets presented so it can be read is still not quite determined. You can do it here, but the site is also for the process.
