At the top of the home page are the thumbnails that pop up the pages of the current book. The original version of this was put up based on the pages at the time the site went up.

My current task is upgrading each of the 62 panels in those 11 pages. In the master file, I've now got 19 panels re-done to the current top standard. That's generally about getting shading, colour correction, and adding faces and hair to the figures. Sometimes it involves wholesale redraws too.

So I'm starting to upgrade the pdfs of the pages, but I wanted my readers to be able to track which were done, and which are yet to do. Hopefully this will be obvious, but just in case, I've colour coded them. The panels yet to be done have a red border on them, and the current top standard panels are the grey of the book design. In the spread above, the first and last panels on both pages are updated: the others are red-bordered and still to come.

I get probably two panels, sometimes three updraded a day. I generally pick one panel on each page and do that. But I'm leaving the first page out â€“ I'm gonna do that all at one go at the end. So pages 2 through 11 are the focus.

I make progress pretty much every day, but I'm only intending on updating the pdfs when I complete the last panel of the each one-per-page tranche of panels. At this rate, I'll have the book up to standard by early December, maybe a little longer...
