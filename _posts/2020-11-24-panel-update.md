Just a quick update: another cycle of panels worked on to "presentation" status, from "presentable".  If you go through the pages of the preamble on the home page, they should be up to date with the latest versions.

All the panels still to be updated have borders in red; but now, I'm picking ahead, and the panels to be done in the next round have been marked in yellow. It takes just under a week to get through one panel per page, so next update will be in about a week.
