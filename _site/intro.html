    <p>As of this late October, 2020, <strong>Neue Welt</strong> consists of an 11-page intro, that’s available for reading on the site’s home page. This page talks about that intro; if <a href="/about">you want to read about the project, that’s here.</a></p>

<p>The original concept for <strong>Neue Welt</strong> doesn’t actually include this section, but I created it to deal with a number of issues. First, it looked like a pretty big project from the get-go, and by creating the intro, I could establish a workflow, and figure out what tools (mostly digital) I was gonna need.</p>

<p>Second, it was focused on the two characters that will carry through the full book, Karolina and Wolf. Where did they come from? What are they like? What happened to them before the story starts, and what effect did that have on them?</p>

<p><img src="https://neue-welt-images.s3.amazonaws.com/posts/Wolf_script_sect.png" alt="Wolf Script Section" /></p>

<p>So, it was a subproject that would tell me a lot about how the book would work and look, and also about what the protagonist and their histories and motivations are.</p>

<p>That being as it was, it needed a plot, but not an ending; this section ends the day before the first chronological events of the book that I’d plotted out start. You can imagine, reading the intro, that the next day, Wolf and Karolina are going to wake up, think about the day and the evening before, and maybe make a decision about what to do.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>

<p>With all that happening, I set out to work. Getting the workflow sorted would, I knew, give me an idea at least of how long it would take to create the book. But as I worked, I also realized that a lot of questions being answered for me in this section would impact the book in multiple ways; small changes at the end would affect the beginning.</p>

<p>For instance, both the characters have a relationship to a fictional town called Magdasbruck. For Wolf, it’s where he was born, where his family farmed, it’s the place that he went to after being traumatized by the First World War, and losing all his siblings to that war, to recover.</p>

<p><img src="https://neue-welt-images.s3.amazonaws.com/posts/Karolina_script_sect.png" alt="Wolf Script Section" /></p>

<p>For Karolina, it has much more negative connotations. It’s where her birth parents died, leaving her not only an orphan, but unable to be connected to any other existing family. It leads to her being first fostered by a Magdasbruck couple, the Stotts, who for their own ease, register her as a new birth, effectively cutting her off from any connection later to her natural family.</p>

<p>The Stotts’ relatives in Berlin, a well-to-do childless couple in Berlin adopt Karolina – even her name is the creation of the family – so she leaves Magdasbruck, and has no real connection reason to like the place.</p>

<p>But when she starts getting into trouble, these Berlin Stotts basically give up on her, and a judge forces her to return to the care of the even older Magdasbruck relatives. For her, it’s little better than a prison, after her wild Berlin life in the heart of the Weimar’s arts and club scene.</p>

<p>With all that going on, it started to make sense to make this section not just a backstory, but a public work that could get people interested in the project. So from quite early on, the plan was pretty much what’s online now, a freely available version of the story, up to the end of the intro.</p>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<p>I also decided that I’d get it online before the full intro was complete. Many of the panels in the intro are in reasonably finished form, but none are (as of this writing) done. There’s so much to do, in particular the obvious things like faces and hair and clothes, and some detailing. Those are drawing-related, and they’ll be starting to happen soon.</p>

<p>The hope is that people who are interested in that process will find the project and start engaging. Where there’s room for input, I’ll be interested in hearing from people following the project. Where you can help me guide the process and decisions to come, I’m welcoming the feedback.</p>

<p>I have also got non-drawing things to do: some photo insertions, some colour correction, some shading. I use different apps for different functions, and the phases of the project are, for me, partly tied to when these tools come into or go out of the production path. For instance, I draw on the iPad in Concepts. It’s brilliant for my linework, but bad for colour and shading. So for that, which lies ahead, I’ll switch to Affinity Photo and Designer. And for page layout, I use Affinity Publisher.</p>

<p>All these tools will be the subject of future posts in the blog-like section of the site, and there’ll be action in the Instagram stream too, about it.</p>
